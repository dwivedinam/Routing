      Don't worry if these examples use tags you have not learned. You will learn about them in the next chapters. HTML Documents
      All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration:
      <!DOCTYPE html>. The HTML document itself begins with
      <html> and ends with
      </html>. The visible part of the HTML document is between

      <body> and </body>.
    </p>
  </mat-card-content>
</mat-card>
